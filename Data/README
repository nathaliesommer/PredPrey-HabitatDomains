README
In this folder are the data for the different versions run on Netlogo.

Any file with 'NCvsC' means that the model has included prey dying
Any file with 'NC' means that the model does not include prey dying (predators are always unsuccessful)

The second part of any name is the length a simulation was run: 1year, 5years or unlimited (until all prey die)

Last part of any name is the date that the simulation was run.
